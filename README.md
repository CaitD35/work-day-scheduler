# work-day-scheduler


## Description
This weeks challenge was to create a workday scheduler using HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
When the user clicks on the link it will open up the scheduler and the current day will be displayed at the top of the calendar. 
When the user scrolls down they will be presented with timeblocks for standard buisness hours and each timeblock is color coded to indicate time in the past,present or future.
When the user clicks on a selected timeblock they can enter an event and save it to local storage.
